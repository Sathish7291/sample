1. Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2
	Multiplexing: HTTP/1.1 loads resources one after the other, so if one resource cannot be loaded, it blocks all the other resources behind it.

3. Read about IP address, port, HTTP methods, MAC address

IP address - An IP address is a unique numerical label assigned to each device connected to a computer network, such as the internet. 
	     It acts as a virtual address that allows devices to communicate and identify each other on the network.
port - A port is a virtual communication channel associated with an IP address.It allows different applications or services running on
       the same device to receive and send data independently. IP address as a building with multiple ports, each leading to a specific application or service.
HTTP methods - HTTP methods are specific commands sent within an HTTP request to instruct the server on how to handle the request.

	       Some commonly used HTTP methods are (GET,POST,PUT,DELETE,PATCH).
MAC address - A MAC address (Media Access Control address) is a unique hardware identifier assigned to each network interface card (NIC) in a device.
	      MAC addresses are typically burned into the hardware and remain static.
